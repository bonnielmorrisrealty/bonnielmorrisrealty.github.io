          </p>
          <p>
            Marcy Unit #1 consists of two floors of living area with an outdoor pergola for entertaining and grilling out.   Marcy can comfortably accommodate up to 19 guest in beds making it the perfect property for large families, Corporate groups or Wedding parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marcy offers all of the comforts of a luxury rental including premium linens, blankets, comforters and bath towels. (Beach towels and chairs are not supplied.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This property has been specifically designed to accommodate large groups with seating in the Marcy for 16+ in the dining/kitchen area;
          </p>
          <p>
            A gorgeous, fully equipped kitchen featuring a walk in pantry with wash sink and dishwasher, stainless steel appliances,  refrigerator, microwave and stove/oven; ample cupboards for storage and unique marble counter top.  Stocked with pots/pans/dishes/glassware/utensils/dishtowels/limited spices/initial supply of paper towels, toilet tissue, ect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marcy is conveniently set up for catering, for those who don't wish to cook during their vacation, I can recommend several excellent caterers for your consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marcy features comfortable couches, smart TV's and WiFi.   In addition the 2nd floor offers a game room with a pool table and wet bar.  The sun room off the kitchen/living area has a queen pull out sofa bed for additional sleeping, tables and chairs, with large windows overlooking the mountains and outdoor pergola where you can enjoy a wood fire for smores, gas grill and lounging/entertainment area.   This area is for the exclusive use of Marcy.
          </p>
          <p>
            All bedrooms offer new high end mattresses, modern full baths, two soaking tubs, and glasses shower.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are air conditioning units available in the bedrooms, however we are fortunate in the Adirondacks to not require AC due to the cool breezes blowing most of the summer months.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the ultimate comfort during the cold times, Placid Peaks House features hardwood floors and custom tile with extremely efficient radiant in-floor heating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Placid Peaks House is located within a 5 minute walk to the Olympic Center,  Mirror Lake and public swimming, shops, restaurants, groceries and pharmacies, hair salons, spas, a fitness center, and family entertainment centers.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional convenience is the free Trolley, which will take you anywhere around town, and the Whiteface Ski shuttle bus that takes you directly to Whiteface Mountain.   Both stop within two blocks of Placid Peaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Adirondacks offer so many opportunities to experience the great outdoors. Numerous nearby lakes and rivers provide our guests with swimming, rafting, boating, kayaking, SUP, canoeing, and fishing. The mountains offer hiking, rock climbing, ice climbing, and of course, winter skiing. Additionally, there are opportunities for horseback riding, snow shoeing, cross country skiing and summer hiking and camping. There are many guide services and ski shops that can help you plan your outdoor events and can rent you all the equipment you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also plenty to do if you are not the "outdoorsy" type: stores, gift shops, theaters, art galleries, book stores, yarn shops, farm markets, Olympic Museums, and stunning road trip opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside Placid Peaks house you will find a notebook that will offer advice on hiking, restaurants along with checking out instructions.   Please feel free to call me any time with questions or suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marcy  accommodates 17 in beds with an additional 2 guest on the queen pull out sofa bed in the sun-room.   Any additional guest must have prior authorization from the Agent and will need to have their own sleeping bed/air mattress and will be charged an additional $50.00 per guest per night.

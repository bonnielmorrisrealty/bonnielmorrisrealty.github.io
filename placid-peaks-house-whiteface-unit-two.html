          </p>
          <p>
            There are air conditioning units available in the bedrooms, however we are fortunate in the Adirondacks to not requite AC due to the cool breezes blowing most of the summer months.

            Placid Peaks House is located within a 5 minute walk to the Olympic Center,  Mirror Lake and public swimming, shops, restaurants, groceries and pharmacies, hair salons, spas, a fitness center, and family entertainment centers.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional convenience is the free Trolley, which will take you anywhere around town, and the Whiteface Ski shuttle bus that takes you directly to Whiteface Mountain.   Both stop within two blocks of Placid Peaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Adirondacks offer so many opportunities to experience the great outdoors. Numerous nearby lakes and rivers provide our guests with swimming, rafting, boating, kayaking, SUP, canoeing, and fishing. The mountains offer hiking, rock climbing, ice climbing, and of course, winter skiing. Additionally, there are opportunities for horseback riding, snow shoeing, cross country skiing and summer hiking and camping. There are many guide services and ski shops that can help you plan your outdoor events and can rent you all the equipment you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also plenty to do if you are not the "outdoorsy" type: stores, gift shops, theaters, art galleries, book stores, yarn shops, farm markets, Olympic Museums, and stunning road trip opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside Placid Peaks house you will find a notebook that will offer advice on hiking, restaurants along with checking out instructions.   Please feel free to call me any time with questions or suggestions.
